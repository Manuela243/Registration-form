# Registration form -- FCC -- assignment
- I started coding via FreeCodeCamp and did an exercise on "Registration form"
- I choose to use my knowledge and build a new Responsive Registration form
- I will be using:
<style>
  span .css {
    color:#ff9966;
</style>
- **HTML**
- <span class="css">**CSS**</span>
