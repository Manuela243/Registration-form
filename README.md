## My process

### Built with

 **HTML** <br>
 **CSS**

### What I learned

1. When having fake link, so that the link does not add # to it, to use onclick="return false;"
2. What we write inside input and how we use for+id to connect it with label
3. Label has to be closed within itself in the same line, and then you put input underneath or above it
4. How to change the pointer
5. To use :hover to change the color of links when you hover over them with your mouse
