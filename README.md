# Registration form -- FCC -- assignment
- I started coding via FreeCodeCamp and did an exercise on "Registration form"
- I choose to use my knowledge and build a new Responsive Registration form
- I will be using:

 **HTML** <br>
 **CSS**

- What I learned to use in this assignment:
1. When having fake link, so that the link does not add # to it, to use onclick="return false;"
2. What we write inside input and how we use for+id to connect it with label
