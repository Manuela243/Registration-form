# Registration form -- FCC -- assignment
- I started coding via FreeCodeCamp and did an exercise on "Registration form"
- I choose to use my knowledge and build a new Responsive Registration form
- I will be using:

 **HTML** <br>
 **CSS**

- All that I have learned while doing this project is written **here**:

1. When having fake link, so that the link does not add # to it, to use onclick="return false;"
2. What we write inside input and how we use for+id to connect it with label
3. Label has to be closed within itself in the same line, and then you put input underneath or above it
4. How to change the pointer
5. To use :hover to change the color of links when you hover over them with your mouse
